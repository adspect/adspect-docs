# Safe Page Generator

Adspect comes with built-in safe page generator developed and maintained by our partner [Comsign](https://www.comsign.io/).
These tools are designed to help you create safe pages quick and easy.

The generator can automatically integrate Adspect streams into generated pages for you:

1.  Create a stream and select No Action for safe page action;
2.  In the Generator section (or on the Safe Page Generator tab of the stream's Integration page,
    which is the same) select the stream to be integrated from the dropdown list and press the Generate button;
3.  Upload the generated ZIP archive to your hosting and unpack.
