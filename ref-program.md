# Referral Program

Adspect has a referral program that lets you earn money for bringing new customers to Adspect.  It works on a revenue share basis,
i.e. you get paid every time your referral customer purchases an Adspect subscription.

**The referral fee is 10%.**  The percentage may be increased individually for those who consistently bring new customers to us.
Please contact us if you have considerable presence on affiliate marketing or SMM forums, blogs, or in Telegram, and we will find
a mutually profitable agreement.

You may find your referral link in your profile.  Use it to promote Adspect, and each new member registered by it will be accounted
as your referral.
